### OMG Mute Me

I don't actually mind seeing ads on Youtube or whatever. Like visually, it's not a big deal.

The problem for me is the audio is always mixed really badly or obnoxious to the point of giving me a headache, so this is just an extension you can install yourself to automatically mute ads.

## Improvements

This only handles Youtube at the moment, so it'd be nice if it worked on other sites like Dailymotion too.

## Installation

I really don't want to setup an Apple developer account or Google developer account and have to worry about keeping up with anything, all that tertiary stuff is so exhausting, so here's a list of ways to install the plugin:

1. Safari: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions
2. Chrome: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/
3. Firefox: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension

If you wanna do any of that yourself and publish it, feel free. Just reference me as a contributing author.
