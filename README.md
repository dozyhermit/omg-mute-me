### OMG Mute Me

I don't actually mind seeing ads on Youtube or whatever. Like visually, it's not a big deal.

The problem for me is the audio is always mixed really badly or obnoxious to the point of giving me a headache, so this is just an extension you can install yourself to automatically mute ads.

## Improvements

There's probably a dozen ways to make the javascript neater/better so feel free to steal this and turn it into your own.

Some things I may or may not do eventually:

1. Observer should only listen on a single DOM element, not the whole page
2. Should work for multiple sites
3. Some other stuff I've forgotten

## Installation

I really don't want to setup an apple developer account or google developer account and have to worry about keeping up with anything, all that tertiary stuff is so exhausting, so here's a list of ways to install the plugin:

1. Safari: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions
2. Chrome: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/
3. Firefox: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension

If you wanna do any of that yourself and publish it, feel free. Just reference me as a contributing author.
